Hi, I'm **Andrew Sanger** and this is my GitHub.

I'm currently looking for work as an entry-level Software Developer. I have experience with most coding languages but mainly in Java. This GitHub is currently a work-in-progress and will be updated a lot in the coming weeks. I intend to supply links to the many projects and assignments ive done over the years.

## Portfolio Projects:
### [Aliens vs Humans](https://github.com/Andrew-Sanger/aliens_vs_humans)
*(Java + JUnit5 Testing)*
A Java Codecademy project to show experience in most java techniques and JUnit5 testing. *(Work in Progress)* 
### [Excursion](https://github.com/Andrew-Sanger/Project-1-Excursion)
*(HTML, CSS, GitHub/GitBash)*
A HTML Codecademy project designed to practice Git/GitBash/GitHub skills, plus very basic webpage design and styling.

## University Projects:
The following are all major coding projects completed in my university courses. Other major projects completed that are not coding based have not been included in this list.

### Programming 1
#### [Project 1 - Basic Car Hire Booking System](https://github.com/Andrew-Sanger/University-Project-01)
*(Java)*
My first major programming project completed in Java (The first time i ever coded in Java.) A simple car booking data entry system, very basic.

#### [Project 2 - Patient Management System](https://github.com/Andrew-Sanger/University-Project-02)
*(Java)*
My second major programming project completed in Java. A simple patient management system. Basic introduction to classes and objects.

#### [Project 3 - Tour Booking System](https://github.com/Andrew-Sanger/University-Project-03)
*(Java)*
The third and final project in the Programming 1 course. A more complicated project than the last two, using more complicated ideas, such as error, exceptions and file handling.

### Programming 2
#### [Project 4 - Library Management System](https://github.com/Andrew-Sanger/University-Project-04)
*(Java)*
The first project in the Programming 2 course. This Java project required the use of a lot more complicated ideas such as UML, objects, abstraction, interfaces, facades etc.

#### [Project 5 - Library Management System GUI](https://github.com/Andrew-Sanger/University-Project-05)
*(Java)*
The second project in the Programming 2 course. This Java project uses a lot of advanced programming techniques and builds upon the first Programming 1 project by creating an easy to use GUI.

***NOTE: Some of the code contained within these assignments was written by the Professor, and is labelled as such at the top of the code. Anything else is my own creation.***
