Hi, I'm **Andrew Sanger** and this is my GitHub.

I'm currently looking for work as an entry-level Software Developer. I have experience with most coding languages but mainly in Java. This GitHub is currently a work-in-progress and will be updated a lot in the coming weeks. I intend to supply links to the many projects and assignments ive done over the years.

## Portfolio Projects:
### [Aliens vs Humans](https://github.com/Andrew-Sanger/aliens_vs_humans)
*(Java + JUnit5 Testing)*
A Java Codecademy project to show experience in most java techniques and JUnit5 testing. *(Work in Progress)* 
### [Excursion](https://github.com/Andrew-Sanger/Project-1-Excursion)
*(HTML, CSS, GitHub/GitBash)*
A HTML Codecademy project designed to practice Git/GitBash/GitHub skills, plus very basic webpage design and styling.

## University Projects:
(To be completed) A place to showcase previous university projects completed, will be uploaded very soon.
